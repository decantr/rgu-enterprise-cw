==========

this repo contains the code for my submission for CM4025 asking students
 to create an RSS reader that featured caching and a consolidated list
 of new articles across all subscribed lists.


requirements
------------

the brief provided required taht this be developed following the
 MVC (model, view, controller) design pattern.

this required a distinction between the following layers;
* presentation, developed using HTML, native Javascript and CSS
* application, developed using PHP
* data, developed using MySQL

it should be noted that the choice was up to the students discretion as
 to what languages they would use to fulfull these requirements.

the brief further required a number of a key features to be targeted;
* a login system
* individual list of feeds per user
* adding, removing and modifying of subscribed feeds
* an consolidated list of feeds
* front end that allows full access to the API
with the following features considered "meritorious";
* proper storing of passwords (salt & hash)
* feeds since last login highlighted
* caching of feeds across user accounts


installation
------------

the spec required this was developed using "PHPMyAdmin" for reproducibility
 however any functioning PHP 7 and MySQL installation should be adequate.
the required SQL tables and their associated commands can be found in the
 `setup.sql` file.
